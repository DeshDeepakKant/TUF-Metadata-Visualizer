# üîç TUF Metadata Visualizer

The **TUF Metadata Visualizer** creates human-readable visual displays of TUF metadata repositories. It shows complex JSON files in a simple, interactive interface. Without this tool, you would need to read and understand raw JSON files across multiple documents. This visualizer uses tables, diagrams, and root.json comparison views to clearly show how different parts of the metadata connect. This makes auditing, reviewing changes, and verifying security much easier.
